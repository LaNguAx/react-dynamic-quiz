# React Dynamic Quiz

A simple quiz app built with **React** and **Vite**.

It uses `useReducer` to manage the quiz state (like progress, score, and status), and fetches questions from a local API. The app shows different screens like loading, the quiz itself, and a final score screen.

Great for practicing React component structure and state management.
